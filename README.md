# Random-Password-Generator


## Project Description:
The task for my coding bootcamp homework was to make a way to make random passwords. First, the user must click the "Generate Password" button. This will bring up a question asking how many characters the user wants their password to be. Then it asks more questions based on the type of characters the user wants to include: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters (standard is to include all but in this task we let the user decide). Then, based on the user's choices, the program will pick characters at random and make a password.

## Pseudo-Code:
* List of numbers, special characters, uppercase and lowercase
* Write function for password input
* Add event listener to generate button
* Prompt = length
* Create var to hold answer to prompt
* Conditional if else statement to ensure user answer to prompt is within range
* Confirm = lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters
* Conditional if else to validate user answers and combine all arrays in 1 array
* Function to randomly capture user determined # of characters from the combined array
* Change function to a string to generate and return password
